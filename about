Joint Dimension Reduction and Clustering in Practice
	Name of instructor:
Assoc. Prof. Angelos Markos, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece.

	Short description:
Joint dimension reduction and clustering (JDRC) refers to a class of multivariate data analysis methods that perform simultaneous dimension reduction and clustering of continuous, categorical or mixed-type data. The key idea of JDRC is that both clustering of objects and a low dimensional subspace reflecting the cluster structure are simultaneously obtained. This short course explains the main features of this class methods, with illustrations to real data in a variety of contexts.
